        <p>Recently, I started using a Fitbit to track my activity levels and to try to motivate me to stay fit. The Fitbit app on my phone keeps track of all the information stored on the device and provides an easy and effective readout of the information. The dashboard consists of all the information that the user chooses to see while keeping track of your progress in different colors. While you are approaching your goal, the numbers turn from red to orange and then to green, along with another visual of a line on the bottom of each section. From there, the user can click on any of the goals to see an overview of their week or their day. I think the design of the app itself is inviting and fun, which can motivate people to want to stay fit. The app is easy to use and understand, and is designed to aid less experienced exercisers in reaching their goals while also providing more advanced options for more experienced users. The colors chosen on each page are inviting and make sense in order to convey different information across similar looking platforms. Each graph page looks similar, yet the navigation is clear and useful. Itâ€™s definitely helping me keep fit and reach new goals every day.</p>

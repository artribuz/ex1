        <h1>1/19: Web-based Form</h1>
        <p>The web based form that I end up using the most is GoogleForms. It’s a fairly common way that most people can gather and record information for studies or surveys. The Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! manager and drum major, amongst other members, send out forms in weekly emails in order to keep track of who is signing up for important performances or football games. It allows them to record the information in an easy to use format. Design wise, the forms themselves are extremely intuitive and comprehensive. They are usually only one page long, although they can be multiple pages, in order to combat fatigue when signing up for things. They can also be equipped with different themes to add a fun flair, as well as different types of boxes or drop down menus to input information. The simple interactive features, as well as the well designed layouts make GoogleForms an easy way to provide and store information for the use of the creator of the form.</p>

        <h1>1/12: Interface Design</h1>
        <p>Recently, I started using a Fitbit to track my activity levels and to try to motivate me to stay fit. The Fitbit app on my phone keeps track of all the information stored on the device and provides an easy and effective readout of the information. The dashboard consists of all the information that the user chooses to see while keeping track of your progress in different colors. While you are approaching your goal, the numbers turn from red to orange and then to green, along with another visual of a line on the bottom of each section. From there, the user can click on any of the goals to see an overview of their week or their day. I think the design of the app itself is inviting and fun, which can motivate people to want to stay fit. The app is easy to use and understand, and is designed to aid less experienced exercisers in reaching their goals while also providing more advanced options for more experienced users. The colors chosen on each page are inviting and make sense in order to convey different information across similar looking platforms. Each graph page looks similar, yet the navigation is clear and useful. It’s definitely helping me keep fit and reach new goals every day.</p>

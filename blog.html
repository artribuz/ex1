        <h1>2/16: UX Book; The Wheel: A Lifecycle Template</h1>
        <p>This chapter primarily talks about the importance of a UX design process, and also provides an in depth template for what the process should look like. The main four steps in this cyclical process are Design, Implement/Prototype, Evaluate, and Analyze. These four steps together can be done in any order, but the book recommends beginning at designing or analyzing and then following the order, backtracking when necessary.</p>
        <p>First, beginning with analysis, the designer(s) must first think of the necessary requirements the user experience needs. The next step requires the creation of interaction design concepts, and then prototyping those designs, either crudely on paper or with a full-fledged mockup. After those steps, the designer(s) must evaluate what is and isn’t working and begin analyzing again. Throughout each step, the designer(s) can be iterating new ideas and fluidly moving through all the steps.</p>
        <p>Often times, this process is cut short due to project parameters, such as what risks the design team can take or the budget. This leads to process parameter choices and what the design team chooses to focus their process on, like how much iteration they can do in each step. The choices the team makes can have the potential to make or break a product.</p>
        <p>Another factor that is important for UX design is understanding what sort of system is being designed for. There is a big difference between designing for a relatively easy-to-use system, like a floral bouquet ordering website, and a hugely complicated system, like an air traffic control system. Understanding the interaction complexity and the work domain complexity of a system is hugely important.</p>
        <p>UX design is often a team effort, with many different kinds of designers working simultaneously to create and iterate throughout the design process. The team is often made up of users, user researchers, user interaction designers, UX analysts, graphic designers, technical writers, interactive prototyping programmers, and most likely a UX manager, someone to be in charge of the team. These people use their combined skills to go through this process together and build off of each other's ideas, thus providing good UX design.</p>
        <p>Most UX design companies follow a generalized version of this design process, with one of the leaders being IDEO. IDEO is a global design company that specializes in UX design and thrives on innovating ideas to turn everyday objects and interactions into better, reimagined, user-centric designs. One of their upcoming projects focuses on the future of automobility. They are reimagining what the user experience will be fifteen years in the future and reinventing the way we travel, each with different themes of how one could travel. These are ideas that have been intricately iterated, analyzed, and evaluated multiple times until the designers came up with solid working ideas to work with. Check out their website <a href="http://automobility.ideo.com/">here!</a></p>
        <p>This lifecycle of a design process is important for all designers, not just for UX design. These steps can be used in almost every design discipline. Each of these aspects can be applied to our class in that everything we design can be made better if we go through a similar design process.</p>

        <h1>2/11: Exercise 5 Library</h1>
        <p>For this assignment, I used both the jQuery UI library and a new library called chosen.js. For my final project, I knew I needed a simpler search function in order to search for specific classes and so on, so chosen.js seemed like a good option because it allows for a search function in the drop down menu so you can search for something specific. In terms of the jQuery UI library, I used the tabs library in order to organize my information. I'm not sure if I liked the outcome of the tabs function, but could prove useful. Both of these libraries were seemingly easy to use, however I'm sort of confused on how to style the chosen.js function. I'm not sure if I'd need to go into the provided code it gives you or if there's a way to style it that I couldn't think of when I was coding my page. Either way, they're both fairly easy to use. Here's the links to the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#default">jQuey UI library</a> and the <a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/">chosen.js library.</a> Please to enjoy.</p>

        <h1>2/4: Exercise 4 Solution</h1>
        <p>My initial solution to this exercise was to have pictures of my items tiled in an interesting way on the home screen and for overlays to pop up and explain what the items were. I thought that was a little too boring and wanted to come up with a different interface, so I came up with the sliding section idea. Glenda helped me figure out the semantics of the website (layering all the sections on top of each other) and then helped me come up with a basis for how to animate it. What I think specifically works well with my design is the simplicity of the design with the straight vertical lines dividing the screen, the interaction of the user with having to click each section in order for something to happen, and the overall colof coordination and typeface. I think all of these things come together well to show and understand the potential interactivity.</p>

        <h1>1/28: Exercise 3 Solution</h1>
        <p>My solution to Exercise 3 turned out fairly nicely. I created a very simple map of my activities, grouping them together by location. I wanted to lead the user on a journey through my five documented hours, but the exact way I wanted them to be led through was still somewhat a mystery. After a lot of sketching, I finally settled on this approach. The interaction of hovering and the icons increasing in size seemed like an intuitive way for the user to understand the functionality of my site, although, more interaction would always be better. I think my site’s simple and intuitive design allows for greater ease of it’s operation.</p>

        <h1>1/19: Web-based Form</h1>
        <p>The web based form that I end up using the most is GoogleForms. It’s a fairly common way that most people can gather and record information for studies or surveys. The Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! manager and drum major, amongst other members, send out forms in weekly emails in order to keep track of who is signing up for important performances or football games. It allows them to record the information in an easy to use format. Design wise, the forms themselves are extremely intuitive and comprehensive. They are usually only one page long, although they can be multiple pages, in order to combat fatigue when signing up for things. They can also be equipped with different themes to add a fun flair, as well as different types of boxes or drop down menus to input information. The simple interactive features, as well as the well designed layouts make GoogleForms an easy way to provide and store information for the use of the creator of the form.</p>

        <h1>1/12: Interface Design</h1>
        <p>Recently, I started using a Fitbit to track my activity levels and to try to motivate me to stay fit. The Fitbit app on my phone keeps track of all the information stored on the device and provides an easy and effective readout of the information. The dashboard consists of all the information that the user chooses to see while keeping track of your progress in different colors. While you are approaching your goal, the numbers turn from red to orange and then to green, along with another visual of a line on the bottom of each section. From there, the user can click on any of the goals to see an overview of their week or their day. I think the design of the app itself is inviting and fun, which can motivate people to want to stay fit. The app is easy to use and understand, and is designed to aid less experienced exercisers in reaching their goals while also providing more advanced options for more experienced users. The colors chosen on each page are inviting and make sense in order to convey different information across similar looking platforms. Each graph page looks similar, yet the navigation is clear and useful. It’s definitely helping me keep fit and reach new goals every day.</p>

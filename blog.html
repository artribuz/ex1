        <h1>2/4: Exercise 4 Solution</h1>
        <p>My initual solution to this exercise was to have pictures of my items tiled in an interesting way on the home screen and for overlays to pop up and explain what the items were. I thought that was a little too boring and wanted to come up with a different interface, so I came up with the sliding section idea. Glenda helped me figure out the semantics of the website (layering all the sections on top of each other) and then helped me come up with a basis for how to animate it. What I think specifically works well with my design is the simplicity of the design with the straight vertical lines dividing the screen, the interaction of the user with having to click each section in order for something to happen, and the overall colof coordination and typeface. I think all of these things come together well to show and understand the potential interactivity.</p>

        <h1>1/28: Exercise 3 Solution</h1>
        <p>My solution to Exercise 3 turned out fairly nicely. I created a very simple map of my activities, grouping them together by location. I wanted to lead the user on a journey through my five documented hours, but the exact way I wanted them to be led through was still somewhat a mystery. After a lot of sketching, I finally settled on this approach. The interaction of hovering and the icons increasing in size seemed like an intuitive way for the user to understand the functionality of my site, although, more interaction would always be better. I think my site’s simple and intuitive design allows for greater ease of it’s operation.</p>

        <h1>1/19: Web-based Form</h1>
        <p>The web based form that I end up using the most is GoogleForms. It’s a fairly common way that most people can gather and record information for studies or surveys. The Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! manager and drum major, amongst other members, send out forms in weekly emails in order to keep track of who is signing up for important performances or football games. It allows them to record the information in an easy to use format. Design wise, the forms themselves are extremely intuitive and comprehensive. They are usually only one page long, although they can be multiple pages, in order to combat fatigue when signing up for things. They can also be equipped with different themes to add a fun flair, as well as different types of boxes or drop down menus to input information. The simple interactive features, as well as the well designed layouts make GoogleForms an easy way to provide and store information for the use of the creator of the form.</p>

        <h1>1/12: Interface Design</h1>
        <p>Recently, I started using a Fitbit to track my activity levels and to try to motivate me to stay fit. The Fitbit app on my phone keeps track of all the information stored on the device and provides an easy and effective readout of the information. The dashboard consists of all the information that the user chooses to see while keeping track of your progress in different colors. While you are approaching your goal, the numbers turn from red to orange and then to green, along with another visual of a line on the bottom of each section. From there, the user can click on any of the goals to see an overview of their week or their day. I think the design of the app itself is inviting and fun, which can motivate people to want to stay fit. The app is easy to use and understand, and is designed to aid less experienced exercisers in reaching their goals while also providing more advanced options for more experienced users. The colors chosen on each page are inviting and make sense in order to convey different information across similar looking platforms. Each graph page looks similar, yet the navigation is clear and useful. It’s definitely helping me keep fit and reach new goals every day.</p>
